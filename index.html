    <h5>In some places, old age is valued, while in other countries youth is considered more important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.
    </h5>


    <p>In contemporary world, some people thing that the role of senior people is essential, and that is why thay should be approciated. While other regard that youngsters are our future, thus we should allocate more concentration in youth. After pondering this phenomenon, I partially agree that youngsters should be cared more as a teenager. This essay will additiate some of the ideas and highlights regarding to this trend. <br><br>
        To start, the majority of people are reckoned to think that the position of youngsters should be in the first place, while forgetting about the rank of the eldrely. Although being valuable in society becouse of their age, youngsters are always be in the second place in terms of their rank level. To cite an example, the servings that seniors contributed to the growth of the country should be admired and that is why honered. Additionally, seniors underwent the life ups and downs, that is to say, they have more experience and knowladge compared to infants, hence, they could be good example of genious survivals for youth. Finally, the position of leader in extended families are also seniors, and they are eligiable to be becouse they can overcome all the problems by themselves. <br><br>
        On the other hand, we should also emphasis about youngsters. Primary reason why youngsters are treated properly than seniors, thay are the ancestors of upcoming future, and the future is in the palm of their hands. It should be cared more when it comes to their education and morality, in this case, seniors would be good option who can literally teach children about life flactuations, beacouse the majority of children would like to listen to their grandparents' words. Furtermore, as a reason of a fact that children share joy to families, thay are essential part of our society. Without kids, the world would be more tedious and the hope of the future would be extinct, and in fact, all people know that human can not live without hope. To keep all of these into an account, we can say that youngsters play substantial role in our lives. <br> <br>

        In conclusion, I definitely agree that both of ages have special importance that human society needs. To calculate, both ages's highlights are equivalent.
